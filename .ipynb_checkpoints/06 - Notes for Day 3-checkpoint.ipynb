    "## So many ways to do the “Triangle” exercise from Chapter 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### The exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "From *Eloquent JavaScript*, the end of [chapter 2](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a loop that makes seven calls to `console.log()` to output the following triangle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#\n",
    "##\n",
    "###\n",
    "####\n",
    "#####\n",
    "######\n",
    "#######\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The “brute force” way\n",
    "\n",
    "This one’s pretty simple: You simply use `console.log()` to print out `#`, `##`, `###`, `####`, `#####`, `######`, and `#######`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "console.log(\"#\")\n",
    "console.log(\"##\")\n",
    "console.log(\"###\")\n",
    "console.log(\"####\")\n",
    "console.log(\"#####\")\n",
    "console.log(\"######\")\n",
    "console.log(\"#######\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#\n",
    "##\n",
    "###\n",
    "####\n",
    "#####\n",
    "######\n",
    "#######\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It works just fine. If you don’t ever expect change the triangle, it’s a perfectly acceptable solution. However, if the requirements are likely to change — *What if we need a triangle with 47 lines? And then what if we need to flip the triangle so that it’s widest at the top?* — you should probably take an approach that makes change easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Any time you see a programming task where you’re counting upwards or downwards, or if something needs to be performed over and over again, there’s a good chance that you should use a loop.\n",
