    "### Notes about the code\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire “brains behind the operation” for this web application is the `calculateTip()` function. Let’s look at it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Get the bill amount, and reject it if it’s not a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the code that does that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const billAmountRaw = document.getElementById(\"bill_amount\").value\n",
    "if (billAmountRaw.length == 0 || isNaN(billAmountRaw)) {\n",
    "  alert(\"Please enter an amount for your bill.\")\n",
    "  return\n",
    "}\n",
    "const billAmount = parseFloat(billAmountRaw)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The user enters the amount of their bill into a text field whose `id` is `bill_amount`. The first thing the code does is get the contents of the `bill_amount` text field and put it into a constant named `billAmountRaw`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const billAmountRaw = document.getElementById(\"bill_amount\").value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you can enter text into a text field, its contents are a string. We’ll check it first to see if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* its length is **0**, which means that the user didn’t enter anything into the `bill_amount` text field, or\n",
    "* what the user entered into the text field isn’t a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (billAmountRaw.length == 0 || isNaN(billAmountRaw)) {\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in `isNaN` function returns `true` if the value you give it is **N**ot **a** **N**umber.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `billAmountRaw` meets either of these conditions, the following lines of code get executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "alert(\"Please enter an amount for your bill.\")\n",
    "return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line causes an alert pop-up to appear. The program stays on this line until the user dismisses the alert pop-up, and then the second line executes, which exits the function. In this case, no other code in the function is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we’ve gotten this far without exiting the function, the next line is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const billAmount = parseFloat(billAmountRaw)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new constant, `billAmount`, which is filled with the value that comes from converting `billAmountRaw`’s contents from a string into a floating-point number. That’s what the built-in `parseFloat()` function does: Given a string, it converts that string into a floating point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Get the rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user selects a rating from a drop-down menu, which is defined by the `<select>` tag in the HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<select id=\"rating\">\n",
    "  <option selected disabled value=\"0\">-- Choose an Option --</option>\n",
    "  <option value=\"0.3\">30% &mdash; Outstanding</option>\n",
    "  <option value=\"0.2\">20% &mdash; Good</option>\n",
    "  <option value=\"0.15\">15% &mdash; It was OK</option>\n",
    "  <option value=\"0.1\">10% &mdash; Bad</option>\n",
    "  <option value=\"0.05\">5% &mdash; Terrible</option>\n",
    "</select>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `<option>` tag inside the `<select>` tag is an option in the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `<option>` tag in the list has some additional attributes that the other `<option>` tags don’t:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `selected`: This makes this menu item the selected one by default.\n",
    "* `disabled`: This disables the menu item. The user can’t select it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first item in the menu is selected and disabled in order to give the user a hint that they should select an item from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the code that handles the rating:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const rating = parseFloat(document.getElementById(\"rating\").value)\n",
    "if (rating == 0) {\n",
    "  alert(\"Please rate your service.\")\n",
    "  return\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code declares a constant named `rating`, gets the `value` of the selected menu item, converts it into a floating-point number, and puts that number into `rating`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `rating` is equal to **0**, it means the user hasn’t selected a rating. In this case, we notify the user that they need to select a rating, and we exit the function. In this case, no other code in the function is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3. Calculate the tip.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we’ve made it this far, we can calculate the tip on the meal’s total cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const totalTip = billAmountRaw * rating\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4. Get the number of people among whom the tip will be divided, calculate the tip each person will pay, and display it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user selects a the number of people from another drop-down menu. The code gets this number by creating a constant named `numPeople`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const numPeople = parseInt(document.getElementById(\"num_people\").value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `parseInt()` function, like `parseFloat()` is built-in. It converts a string into an integer (whole number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the number of people, we can calculate how much each person should tip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const individualTip = totalTip / numPeople\n",
    "const individualTipDisplay = individualTip.toFixed(2)\n",
    "document.getElementById(\"tip\").innerHTML = individualTipDisplay\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a pretty good chance that the value in `individualTip` will include fractions smaller than a penny — that is, it will contain more than 2 decimal places. That’s why we use the built-in `toFixed()` function to convert `individualTip` into a string, and round the value to 2 decimal places.\n"
