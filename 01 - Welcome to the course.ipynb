    "## What this course covers\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is an introduction to the JavaScript programming language and the React user interface framework. It is designed for students with little or no programming experience and a little familiarity with HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will be divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weeks 1 - 4 will focus on the JavaScript language.** It starts with the fundamentals of the JavaScript language, and quickly progresses to apply those fundamentals through the building of small projects. By the end of this part of the course, students will have a good understanding of programming principles, be able to write single-page web applications, and know how to research other JavaScript programming topics.\n",
    "2. **Weeks 5 - 8 will focus on the React framework,** one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. It builds on the knowledge from weeks 1 - 6 and covers four major concepts in React: JSX, props, state, and the newly-introduced hooks. As with the first part of the course, these concepts will be reinforced through small projects. By the end of this part of the course, students will have a good foundation of React programming, be able to write complex single-page web applications, and know how to research React-related programming topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript and React are both rapidly evolving, and this course takes that fact into account. This course covers the 2020 editions of JavaScript and React, but also prepares students to work with earlier versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a passive course where you sit back and listen to a lecture. Instead, it’s a “code as you go” course where you code along with the instructor and learn by doing. At the end of every class, you’ll have written some code, and you may even complete a small project."
