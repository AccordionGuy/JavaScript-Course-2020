    "\n",
    "You’ll need to install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) and [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/); pretty much all the work in the course will rely on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you install these applications, here’s a quick explanation of what they are.\n",

    "\n",
    "[**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) (pronounced “Node J S” or simply “Node”) is an engine that allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser. Priort to Node, JavaScript engines existed only in browsers, and as a result, JavaScript programs could only exist and run inside web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node is built on [V8](https://v8.dev/), the efficient and powerful JavaScript engine inside the Chrome browser, but instead of running inside a browser, it runs inside a computer operating system, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. With Node, JavaScript graduated from a webpage-only programming language to a general purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you’ll use Node to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enter short JavaScript commands and get immediate feedback\n",
    "* Write programs that you’ll run on your computer\n",
    "* Write the “back end” of web applications\n",

    "\n",
    "[**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) is short for Node Package Manager. It’s an application that lets you download and install pre-written packages of JavaScript code (think of them as “plugins for programmers”) for use in your own JavaScript programs. By using these packages, you’re saved from having to “reinvent the wheel”.\n",
