    "## The Magic 8-Ball\n",
    "\n",
    "### The goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exercise was to develop a simple game: Our own version of the [“Magic 8-Ball”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) toy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how the toy works: You ask it a question that should be answered with “yes” or “no”, and it provides a random answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "[You can try an online version of the Magic 8-Ball here.](http://www.ask8ball.net/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to create our own version of the toy as a web app. The user should be able to click a button and get a random answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The general principle behind the app\n",
    "\n",
    "The app makes use of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An array of strings, each one being a Magic 8-Ball answer, such as “Yes”, “Maybe”, “No”, and so on. Since these strings are in an array, we can access them by number.\n",
    "2. The `Math.random()`, function, which generates random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app generates random answers by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It generates a random number.\n",
    "2. It uses that random number to select an answer from the array of answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The initial setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with an HTML file, and made some changes to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <script></script>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "  <h1>Magic 8-Ball</h1>\n",
    "  <p>Ask a \"yes\" or \"no\" question and I'll answer it!</p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "    <label for=\"text_field\">Put your question here:</label>\n",
    "    <input id=\"text_field\" name=\"text_field\" type=\"text\">\n",
    "    <button id=\"ask_button\">Ask!</button>\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <br />\n",
    "  <p id=\"answer\"></p>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what the resulting web page looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.globalnerdy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/initial-web-page.jpg\" width=\"350\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll write code so that when the user clicks the **Ask!** button (whose `id` attribute is `ask_button`), a JavaScript function will be called so that the `<p>` tag whose `id` is `answer` will be filled with a random answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a function to create the random answers\n",
    "\n",
    "We added the following JavaScript function to the `<script>` section of the HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function randomAnswer() {\n",
    "  const answers = [\"Yes\", \"No\", \"Maybe\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "  let answerNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * answers.length)\n",
    "  let answer = answers[answerNumber]\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"answer\").innerHTML = answer\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s review what the code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it defines the array of answers. Since we’re not going to change this list while the program is running, we’ll declare it as a constant with the `const` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating the random number\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to generate the random number in the range of the `answers` array indexes. Right now, the array looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <th>Index</th>\n",
    "        <th>Value</th>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>0</td>\n",
    "        <td>Yes</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>1</td>\n",
    "        <td>No</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>2</td>\n",
    "        <td>Maybe</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the random number should be between 0 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in `Math.random()` function generates random numbers between 0 and 1, but not including 0 or 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you open Node and keep typing in `Math.random()`, you’ll see numbers like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0.0590488099832549\n",
    "0.9264895696930278\n",
    "0.48719055823525714\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick to generating random numbers that go beyond the range of numbers between 0 and 1, you typically multiply the result of `Math.random()` by the number of random results you want. For example, if you want random numbers in the range of 0, 1, and 2, that’s three random results, so you multiply the result of `Math.random()` by 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open Node and keep typing in `Math.random() * 3`, you’ll see numbers like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1.1221438511871558\n",
    "0.9280521672410447\n",
    "2.4535464056763594\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll see random numbers between 0 and 3, but not including 0 or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we want whole numbers. We can do this by using the `Math.floor()` function to round the results down to nearest whole number.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open Node and keep typing in `Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)`, you’ll see numbers like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "0\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a very good chance that we’ll change the `answers` array by adding new answers to it, so let’s make the random number generator based on the array length. That’s why its code reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let answerNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * answers.length)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Displaying the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a random number, `answerNumber`, we can use it to access an answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let answer = answers[answerNumber]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And once we have an answer, we can update the `<p>` tag at the bottom of the webpage — the one whose `id` attribute is `answer`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "document.getElementById(\"answer\").innerHTML = answer\n",
    "```"
