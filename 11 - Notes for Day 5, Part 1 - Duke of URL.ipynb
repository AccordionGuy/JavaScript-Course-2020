    "# Notes for Day 5, part 1: Duke of URL\n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Using what you learned from Day 4, where we wrote a “Magic 8-Ball” web app, write a web app with a button that when pressed, takes the user to a randomly-selected web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you already knew\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. You already knew how to execute JavaScript code when the user presses a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do this by using the `onclick` attribute in the `<button>` tag. In class, we’ve been using calls to JavaScript functions in `onclick` like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<button onclick=\"doSomething()\">Click me</button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML above creates a button that calls the `doSomething()` function when clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put *any* JavaScript in the `onClick` attribute — it doesn’t have to be just calls to functions. Copy the following, save it as an HTML file, view it in your browser, and click the button repeatedly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "<button onclick=\"document.body.style.backgroundColor = ['tomato', 'lightgreen', 'lightskyblue', 'coral', 'mediumvioletred'][Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)]\">Click me</button>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the code in the `onclick` attribute seems mysterious, look at it piece by piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, your code will be easier to maintain if you put it in a function rather than jamming it all into `onclick`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. You already knew how to generate random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript has a built-in object called `Math`, and it contains a lot of functions. One of these functions is `Math.random()`, which generates random numbers between 0 and 1. Here’s a short list of the sort of random numbers it generates:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0.0590488099832549\n",
    "0.9264895696930278\n",
    "0.48719055823525714\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate random *whole* numbers between 0 and *n*, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiply the output of `Math.random()` by *n*\n",
    "* Round it down to the nearest whole number\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do that with this statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Math.floor(Math.random() * n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. You already knew how to use arrays, which are lists of things that are indexed by number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of setting up an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"durian\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets up a constant named `fruits` that contains the following items:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <th>Index</th>\n",
    "        <th>Value</th>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>0</td>\n",
    "        <td>apple</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>1</td>\n",
    "        <td>banana</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>2</td>\n",
    "        <td>cherry</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>3</td>\n",
    "        <td>durian</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "You access the contents of an array using **array notation**, which is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The name of the array\n",
    "2. Followed the by the index of the item you want to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that array indexes start at **0**, not **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first item of the `fruits` array is `fruits[0]`, which is `\"apple\"`.\n",
    "* The second item of the `fruits` array is `fruits[1]`, which is `\"banana\"`.\n",
    "* The third item of the `fruits` array is `fruits[2]`, which is `\"cherry\"`.\n",
    "* The fourth and final item of the `fruits` array is `fruits[3]`, which is `\"durian\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "A lot of what you’ll do while programming, no matter if you’re a beginner or have been doing it for 20 years, is Googling. We’re fortunate that a lot of programmers like to post solutions that they’ve learned or figured out online.\n",

    "    * The `Math` object, which is a collection of useful math functions.\n",

    "* We looked at the `window` object’s properties and methods, and found a couple that we might be able to use:\n",
