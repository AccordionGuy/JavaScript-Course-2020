    "## Pomodoro timer\n",
    "\n",
    "### A *what* timer?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pomodorotimer.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pomodoro* is the Italian word for “tomato”. The [Pomodoro Technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) is a time-management technique where you alternate betweeen:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A 25-minute period called a *pomodoro*, where you focus on a single task, and\n",
    "* frequent short breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique was named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that its inventor used to keep track of the time he had to focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key part of the Pomodoro Technique is the use of a countdown timer to measure the 25-minute work periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes it work: The `window` object’s `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` methods\n",
    "\n",
    "You may remember from the previous set of notes that the [browser’s `window` object,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) the represents the browser tab that holds the current webpage:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/browser-window-object.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also remember that objects can come with built-in functions, which are called **methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `window` object comes with a number of methods, two of which are useful for setting up code to be executed at regular intervals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `setInterval()`, which tells the window to run a specific function every time a certain amount of time in milliseconds has elapsed, and\n",
    "* `clearInterval()`, which tells the window to stop running that specific function every time a certain amount of time in milliseconds has elapsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the timer is running, the code for the pomodoro app calls the `update()` method every 1000 milliseconds, which is equivalent to one second. The `update()` method will remove one second from the remaining time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the code for the web page that makes up the pomodoro timer app:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "<script>\n",
    "let timer = null\n",
    "let timeRemaining = 60 * 25 // 25 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "function setup() {\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = false\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"stop_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function startTimer() {\n",
    "  timer = window.setInterval(update, 1000)\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"stop_button\").disabled = false\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function stopTimer() {\n",
    "  window.clearInterval(timer)\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = false\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"stop_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function update() {\n",
    "  timeRemaining--\n",
    "  const minutes = Math.floor(timeRemaining / 60)\n",
    "  const seconds = timeRemaining % 60\n",
    "  let displayMinutes = minutes.toString()\n",
    "  if (minutes < 10) {\n",
    "    displayMinutes = \"0\" + displayMinutes\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  let displaySeconds = seconds.toString()\n",
    "  if (seconds < 10) {\n",
    "    displaySeconds = \"0\" + displaySeconds\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"clock\").innerHTML = `${displayMinutes}:${displaySeconds}`\n",
    "\n",
    "  if (timeRemaining == 0) {\n",
    "    stopTimer()\n",
    "    document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "    document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"red\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "\n",
    "<body onload=\"setup()\">\n",
    "<h1>Pomodoro Timer</h1>\n",
    "<button id=\"start_button\" onclick=\"startTimer()\">Start</button>\n",
    "<button id=\"stop_button\" onclick=\"stopTimer()\">Stop</button>\n",
    "<p id=\"clock\"></p>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A quick look at the JavaScript in this page\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Global variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the Javacript at the start of the `<script>` tag:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let timer = null\n",
    "let timeRemaining = 60 * 25 // 25 minutes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This declares two **global variables**: `timer` and `timeRemaining`. They’re called global variables because they’re not inside any function, which means that they’re available to all functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable declared inside a function is called a **local variable**. It’s called a local variable because they’re limited to the function they’re declared in. No other function can read the value it contains, or change the value it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `setup()`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the `<body>` tag in the HTML, you’ll see that it has an `onload` attribute, and that its value is set to `setup()`. This means that the `setup()` function is called whenever the page is loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `setup()` method is pretty simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function setup() {\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = false\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"stop_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All is does is enable the **Start** button and disable the **Stop** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `startTimer()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Start** button has an `onclick` attribute, and its value is set to `startTimer()`. This means that the `startTimer()` function is called whenever the **Start** button is clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function startTimer() {\n",
    "  timer = window.setInterval(update, 1000)\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"stop_button\").disabled = false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timer = window.setInterval(update, 1000)` line tells the window to execute the `update()` function every 1000 milliseconds, and puts a reference to the internal timer that drives this process, so we can stop it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two lines disable the **Start** button and enable the **Stop** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `stopTimer()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Stop** button has an `onclick` attribute, and its value is set to `stopTimer()`. This means that the `stopTimer()` function is called whenever the **Stop** button is clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function stopTimer() {\n",
    "  window.clearInterval(timer)\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = false\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"stop_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `window.clearInterval(timer)` line tells the window to stop the process referred to int he `timer` variable, which is the one that executes the `update()` function every 1000 milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two lines enable the **Start** button and disable the **Stop** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `update()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `update()` function is called every second when the timer is running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function update() {\n",
    "  timeRemaining--\n",
    "  const minutes = Math.floor(timeRemaining / 60)\n",
    "  const seconds = timeRemaining % 60\n",
    "  let displayMinutes = minutes.toString()\n",
    "  if (minutes < 10) {\n",
    "    displayMinutes = \"0\" + displayMinutes\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  let displaySeconds = seconds.toString()\n",
    "  if (seconds < 10) {\n",
    "    displaySeconds = \"0\" + displaySeconds\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  document.getElementById(\"clock\").innerHTML = `${displayMinutes}:${displaySeconds}`\n",
    "\n",
    "  if (timeRemaining == 0) {\n",
    "    stopTimer()\n",
    "    document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "    document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"red\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line, `timeRemaining--` simply reduces the number of seconds in `timeRemaining` by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few lines convert the number of seconds in `timeRemaining` to minutes and seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the number of minutes is easy: Divide the number of seconds in `timeRemaining` by 60 and ignore any fractional parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const minutes = Math.floor(timeRemaining / 60)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the number of seconds is also easy: Get the remainder that occurs when you divide the number of seconds in `timeRemaining` by 60:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const seconds = timeRemaining % 60\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the minutes and seconds to be formatted so that if either of those values is a single digit, we add a **0** in front of the value (for example, **5** becomes **05**, **9** becomes 09**). Then we display the minutes and seconds remaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let displayMinutes = minutes.toString()\n",
    "if (minutes < 10) {\n",
    "    displayMinutes = \"0\" + displayMinutes\n",
    "}\n",
    "let displaySeconds = seconds.toString()\n",
    "if (seconds < 10) {\n",
    "    displaySeconds = \"0\" + displaySeconds\n",
    "}\n",
    "document.getElementById(\"clock\").innerHTML = `${displayMinutes}:${displaySeconds}`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, function checks to see if the clock has run out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (timeRemaining == 0) {\n",
    "    stopTimer()\n",
    "    document.getElementById(\"start_button\").disabled = true\n",
    "    document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"red\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the clock has run out, the code stops the timer, disabled the **Start** button, and changes the page’s background color to red."
