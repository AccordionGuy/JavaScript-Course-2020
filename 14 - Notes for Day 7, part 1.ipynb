    "### The goal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mad Libs** is a word game where one player (“the reader”) asks the other players for a list of words. The reader then uses those words to fill in the blanks in a story, which is then read aloud. The result is usually funny.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise was to write a web application that let user play this Mad Libs game, with the computer acting as the reader. Here’s the pen-and-paper version of the game we want to program:\n",

    "\n",
    "The user will fill out the text fields, and then click the **Give me the story!** button. The program takes what the user entered and uses it to fill in the blanks in the story, and displays the resulting story at the bottom of the page:\n",

    "### Notes about the code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `$()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to get access to the text field whose `id` is `adjective_1`. We’ve had lots of practice doing this by now, and would use code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "document.getElementById(\"adjective_1\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On a web page, we get access to HTML elements by `id` a lot, and `document.getElementById` is a lot of typing. It would be nice if we could do it with less typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that we *can* do it with less typing. We can define a function with a shorter name that calls `document.getElementById()`!\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what the `$()` function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function $(id) {\n",
    "  return document.getElementById(id)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the `$()` function as a go-between between you and `document.getElementById()`. To get a specific HTML element by an id, you pass the id to `$()`. `$()` calls `document.getElementById()` using the id value that you provided. `document.getElementById()` returns the HTML element to `$()`, which in turn returns it back to you:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.globalnerdy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dollar-function-explained.jpg\" width=\"275\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Okay, what’s up with giving a function a name like `$`?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s talk about names for variables, constants, and functions. The rules are simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable, constant, and function names can contain:\n",
    "    * Letters (upper- and lowercase)\n",
    "    * Numbers\n",
    "    * Dollar signs (`$`)\n",
    "    * Underscores (`_`)\n",
    "* Names can begin with letters, dollar signs, or underscores, but *not* numbers.\n",
    "* Variable, constant, and function names can be as short as one character, as long as it follows the rules above.\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules mean that you can create variable and constant names like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const x = 5\n",
    "let _ = \"Hello there!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "function $(id) {\n",
    "  return document.getElementById(id)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we use `$()` as a shorter-named substitute for the much longer `document.getElementById()` is mostly tradition. In the 2000s, there was a popular JavaScript library (a collection of functions that you can import into your own projects) called [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and one of the functions it provided was the `$()` function, which did exactly what our `$()` function does: it makes `document.getElementById()` much easier to type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What the code does\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the work we did, the code’s actually pretty simple. It does just 2 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It defines a constant named `story`, using a combination of pre-written text and the contents of the text fields. The `$()` function makes this easier.\n",
    "* Once `story` has been defined, the code uses it to set the `innerText` property of the HTML element whose `id` attribute is `completed_story`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
