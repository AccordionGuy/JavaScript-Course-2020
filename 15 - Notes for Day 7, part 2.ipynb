    "## Our goal for the end of the week\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for the end of the week is to be able to write a weather web app like this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/finished-weather-app.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s pretty straightforward. The user enters the name of a city and clicks the *Get the weather* button. The app displays the current weather for that city.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that we’ll be writing a weather web app is that it’s similar to all sorts of web apps. They all do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The web app gets input from the user.\n",
    "* The web app sends that input to a server.\n",
    "* The server sends a reply back to the web app.\n",
    "* The web app uses that reply to display information to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how all sorts of web applications work: weather, online shopping, ridesharing, ordering a pizza — they all follow this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenWeatherMap.org and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) is an online service that provides global weather data of all sorts — current weather data, forecasts, and historical weather data going back to 1979. It’s a central source of weather information, pulling its data from weather and radar stations from all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenWeatherMap provides this information through **APIs**. “API” is short for “Application Programming Interface”, and it’s a way for computers to communicate with each other. Just as a user interface lets a user send instructions and requests to a computer, an application programming interface lets and application send instructions and requests to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more about APIs, see this article by *freeCodeCamp*: [**What is an API? In English, please.**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "When OpenWeatherMap provides its information, it does so in a format called **JSON**, which is short for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a way to format information in an organized manner that’s easy to read, and it just happens to follow the way we define JavaScript objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## JavaScript objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a set of properties, and each property is made up of a **key** and a **value**. Here’s an example of an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let hotSauce1 = { name: \"Cholula Hot Sauce\", heat: 3600 }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines an object with two keys: `name` and `heat`. The value for `name` is `\"Cholula Hot Sauce\"` and the value for heat is `3600`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, objects are great for modeling real-world things with lots of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have also noticed that objects are defined using curly brackets (`{` and `}`). This means that yes, curly brackets mean two things in JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the curly brackets contain code, it means you’re not dealing with an object. It means you’re dealing with a block of code.\n",
    "* If the curly brackets contain properties — that is, keys and values separated by `:` characters, it means you’re dealing with an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You access the contents of an object using **dot notation**. For example, if you wanted the name of the hot sauce represented by `hotSauce1`, you’d use this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hotSauce1.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d get the value `'Cholula Hot Sauce'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you wanted the heat rating of `hotSauce1`, you’d use this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hotSauce1.heat\n",
    "```\n",
    "You’d get the value `3600`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try to access a non-existent property using a non-existent key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hotSauce1.price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d get the value `undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose Cholula changed their recipe and made their sauce even hotter — say, 8000 Scoville heat units. Here’s how you’d change the `hotSauce1` object to match:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hotSauce1.heat = 8000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects can contain other objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An object’s properties can hold any kind of value, which includes objects!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let city = { name: \"Tampa\", coordinates: { lat: 27.9506, lon: 82.4572 } }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the object above, there are two properties: `name`, which holds a string, and `coordinates`, which holds an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the coordinates in `city`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "city.coordinates\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d get the value `{ lat: 27.9506, lon: 82.4572 }`\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the individual latitude and longitude values inside coordinates, you’d use an extra level of dots:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "city.coordinates.lat\n",
    "city.coordinates.lon\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These lines would give you `27.9506` and `82.4572`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects can contain arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "An object’s properties can also hold arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let item = { name: \"T-shirt\", sizes: [\"S\", \"M\", \"L\", \"XL\"] }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the object above, there are two properties: `name`, which holds a string, and `sizes`, which holds an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the sizes of `item`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "item.sizes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d get the value `[ 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL' ]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the individual items in the `sizes` array, use array notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "item.sizes[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d get the value `'L'`. Remember that array indexes start at 0, not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays can contain objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of a small list of students:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let students = [\n",
    "    { name: \"Alice\", level: 2 },\n",
    "    { name: \"Bob\", level: 3 },\n",
    "    { name: \"Carol\", level: 1 }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you’d access the second student in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "students[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d get the value `{ name: 'Bob', level: 3 }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the name of the second student in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "students[1].name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d get the value `'Bob'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the level of the first student in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "students[0].level\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d get the value `2`.\n",
    "\n"
