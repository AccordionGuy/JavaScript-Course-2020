    "## The challenge\n",
    "Create a component called `House` to model a home with 4 rooms, each with its own light and lightswitch. Use state to keep track of whether each light is on or off. Add 4 buttons to represent the light switches, and flip the respective light on or off when the buttons are clicked. Use this initial state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "state = {\n",
    "  kitchen: true, \n",

    "\n",
    "## A first pass at the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by creating a new React project. Open the command line (Command Prompt in Windows, Terminal in macOS or Linux), and use the `create-react-app` command to create a new React app named **House**:\n",

    "```\n",
    "create-react-app house\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `create-react-app` has created the app, open the **App.js** file (it’s in the **src** directory). It will contain the auto-generated code for the default React app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Delete all the code in **App.js** and replace it with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react' // 1\n",
    "import './App.css'\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what the code does (follow the numbered comments):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import React from 'react'`<br />\n",
    "This makes the code for the `React` class available to your code. We’re importing it because we’ll use it to make React components by *subclassing* the `React` class. (*Subclassing* is just a fancy computer science term for “Making a class based on another class.”)\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `House` class<br />\n",
    "This defines the `House` component. Because it has to remember whether each room’s light is on or off, it makes use of a `state` property, which means we need to use a class instead of a function.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `House` class’ `state` property<br />\n",
    "As I’m fond of saying, classes create objects, and objects *know things* and *do things*. Properties define what an object *knows*, and this property stores the status of the light in each of the rooms in the house — `true` if the light is on, and `false` if it’s off.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `House` class’ `toggle` methods<br />\n",
    "Just as properties define what an object *knows*, methods define what an object *does*. These methods toggle the lights on and off in the kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedroom.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `House` class’ `render` method<br />\n",
    "    * This method defines what the `House` component displays, which is four buttons, labeled “Kitchen”, “Bathroom”, “Living room”, and “Bedroom”. Clicking a button causes the appropriate `toggle` method to be called. Each button displays the room’s name and its light status — **On** if its state value is `true`, or **Off** if its state value is `false`.\n",
    "    * Each `Button` tag has an `onClick` attribute that calls a specific method when its corresponding button is clicked. For example, the **Kitchen** button’s `onClick` attribute causes the `toggleKitchen` method to be called when it’s clicked.\n",
    "    * Within each `Button` tag is a ternary operator expression that controls the display of the corresponding room’s light status: **On** or **Off**.<br />\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The `App` function<br />\n",
    "This defines the `App` component, which draws the `House` component.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `export default App`<br />\n",
    "This makes the `App` component available for import by other code. `App` is imported by the code in the **index.js** file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A second pass at the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the “toggle” methods are pretty much the same thing, just for different rooms:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "toggleKitchen = (event) => {\n",
    "  this.setState({kitchen: !this.state.kitchen})\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "toggleBathroom = (event) => {\n",
    "  this.setState({bathroom: !this.state.bathroom})\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "toggleLivingRoom = (event) => {\n",
    "  this.setState({livingRoom: !this.state.livingRoom})\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "toggleBedroom = (event) => {\n",
    "  this.setState({bedroom: !this.state.bedroom})\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn’t it be better if there was just a single “toggle” method that would take a parameter specifying which room’s lights should be toggled? Something like this?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "toggleLights = (room) => {\n",
    "  // Do something to toggle the given room’s light\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With a “toggle” method like this, we’d call it from the button’s `onClick` attribute like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "render() {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={this.toggleLights(\"kitchen\")}>Kitchen: {this.state.kitchen ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={this.toggleLights(\"bathroom\")}>Bathroom: {this.state.bathroom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={this.toggleLights(\"livingRoom\"})>Living room: {this.state.livingRoom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={this.toggleLights(\"bedroom\")}>Bedroom: {this.state.bedroom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  )\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing a parameter from `onClick`\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried rewriting the `onClick` code in the buttons:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "render() {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={this.toggleLights(\"kitchen\")}>Kitchen: {this.state.kitchen ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={this.toggleLights(\"bathroom\")}>Bathroom: {this.state.bathroom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={this.toggleLights(\"livingRoom\"})>Living room: {this.state.livingRoom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={this.toggleLights(\"bedroom\")}>Bedroom: {this.state.bedroom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  )\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if you call a function from within an `onClick` attribute, you need to do so from within an arrow function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we rewrote `render` this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "render() {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={() => this.toggleLights('kitchen')}>Kitchen: {this.state.kitchen ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={() => this.toggleLights('bathroom')}>Bathroom: {this.state.bathroom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={() => this.toggleLights('livingRoom')})>Living room: {this.state.livingRoom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "      <p><button onClick={() => this.toggleLights('bedroom')}>Bedroom: {this.state.bedroom ? \"On\": \"Off\"}</button></p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  )\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to write the `toggleLights` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing the `toggleLights` function\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in React, we can’t simply change the `state` object’s property values directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// This won’t work\n",
    "this.state.kitchen = false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "React requires us to use the `setState` method to change the `state` object’s property values\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState({kitchen: false})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to make changes to several `state` properties at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState({\n",
    "  kitchen: false,\n",
    "  bathroom: true,\n",
    "  livingRoom: true,\n",
    "  bedroom: false\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So `toggleLights` should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "toggleLights = (room) => {\n",
    "  this.setState({room: !this.state.room})\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This won’t work, because JavaScript interprets `room` literally, and not as a variable. It’s trying change the `room` property of the `state` object. What we want is for JavaScript to change the property whose name is contained inside the variable named `room`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There might be a way. Remember that there are a couple of ways to access the properties of an object. For example, to get the status of the light in the kitchen, we could do it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const status = state.kitchen\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But there’s another way to do it — using square brackets, in a manner similar to the way we get the contents of an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const status = state[\"kitchen\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`state[\"kitchen\"]` means “the `kitchen` property of the `state` object”.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if you do this instead? Note that this time, `kitchen` is *not* in quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const status = state[kitchen]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`state[kitchen]` means “the property of the `state` object” whose name is stored inside the variable named `kitchen`. If `kitchen` contains the string `basement`, `status` will be assigned the value contained within `state.basement` (or, expressed another way, `state[\"basement\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if square brackets work the same way *inside* an object? Let’s try this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "toggleLights = (room) => {\n",
    "  this.setState({[room]: !this.state.[room]})\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It works! "
